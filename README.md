A modern implementation of the classic Snake game built for Android using Jetpack Compose.

- Big Credits to [Juraj Kusnier](https://youtu.be/O3vsO8CR8VI?si=fB8iqJd4ULAQESQ2), as I started to work on this because on one random day I stumbled upon this video on YouTube and tryna follow along to build this OG game with `Jetpack Compose` (which was what I wanna learn at that time). 

- After building the main gameplay according to the video, I feel like I can do more than just that so decided to add more features and gameplay mode to recreate the retro game that we all once played in our childhood ‚ú®

<h3> üéÆ Game Concept </h3>

Retro Snake is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating
food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. The game gets progressively
more challenging as the snake grows longer, requiring quick reflexes and strategic planning.

- Modern Material Design UI to recreate the retro style of classic snake game
- Multiple gameplay mode (Classic, Walls Challenge, Speed Challenge)

- Supports three languages (Chinese, English, Malay)

<h3> üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack </h3>

- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern Android UI toolkit
- **Android Architecture Components** - Following MVVM pattern

<h3> üéØ Game Controls </h3>
